Given an input text describing a customer service inquiry, analyze the content to determine its urgency, sentiment, and relevant categories. Return a JSON string with the following keys: "urgency" (values: "high", "medium", "low"), "sentiment" (values: "negative", "neutral", "positive"), and "categories" (a dictionary with boolean values for each category). Ensure the JSON is valid and concise, without unnecessary whitespace or newlines. Use the context of facility management to accurately classify the input.
