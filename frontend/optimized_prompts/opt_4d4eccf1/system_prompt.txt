Analyze the input email to extract structured information, ensuring compliance with data privacy standards (e.g., avoid storing personal identifiers). Return a JSON string with "urgency" (high/medium/low), "sentiment" (negative/neutral/positive), and "categories" (boolean flags for predefined service types).

**Instructions:**
- Identify urgency from keywords like "urgent" or "immediate".
- Determine sentiment based on tone (e.g., "appreciate" = positive).
- Match content to categories (e.g., "specialized cleaning" maps to `specialized_cleaning_services: true`).
- Output valid JSON without formatting or extra whitespace.
