Instructions:
1. **Urgency Level**: Assess the email's urgency based on keywords and context. Assign `high` for immediate issues, `medium` for non-urgent but important matters, and `low` for routine or informational requests.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the sentiment by evaluating the tone and language used. Use `positive` for appreciative or satisfied messages, `neutral` for factual or straightforward content, and `negative` for complaints or dissatisfaction.
3. **Category Identification**: Match the email content to predefined categories. Set the value to `true` if the category is relevant, otherwise `false`. Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) by not including personal information in the output.
