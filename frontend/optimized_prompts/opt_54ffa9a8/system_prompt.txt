Given the following customer service email, analyze the content to extract structured information. Identify the urgency (low, medium, high), sentiment (negative, neutral, positive), and relevant categories from the predefined list. Return the results as a compact JSON object without formatting. Consider implicit cues like tone and phrasing for sentiment, and urgency indicators like "urgent" or "at your earliest convenience." Use boolean flags for categories, ensuring only pertinent ones are marked true.
