# Nova Prompt Optimizer - Development Rules

## Code Modification Policy

### Rule: No Fresh Implementations Without Explicit Approval

**ðŸš« PROHIBITED WITHOUT PERMISSION:**
- Creating "clean" versions of existing files
- Rewriting entire functions or classes for troubleshooting
- Major refactoring or restructuring of code
- Fresh implementations to replace existing working code

**âœ… ALLOWED:**
- Minimal, targeted fixes to address specific errors
- Surgical changes to resolve immediate issues
- Small additions or modifications to existing code
- Bug fixes that preserve existing structure

**ðŸ“‹ PROCESS:**
1. **Identify the specific issue** that needs fixing
2. **Make minimal changes** to address only that issue
3. **Preserve existing code structure** and patterns
4. **Ask for explicit permission** before any major changes or rewrites

**ðŸŽ¯ PRINCIPLE:**
Fix the exact problem with the least amount of code change possible. When in doubt, ask for permission before making broader changes.
