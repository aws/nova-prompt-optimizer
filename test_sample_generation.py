Since you've checked the physical connections, let's try a few more steps. On your laptop, go to the 'Devices and Printers' section in the Control Panel. Find your printer in the list, right-click on it, and select 'See what's printing.' If there are any pending print jobs, cancel them. Then, right-click on the printer again and select 'Use Printer Online' to ensure it's set to online status. If the issue persists, we might need to restart both your laptop and the printer.
